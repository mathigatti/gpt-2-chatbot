# GPT-2 Chatbot

This is a basic chatbot using GPT-2. The chatbot is in english but it uses google translate to work in spanish (You can change it to any other language [here](https://github.com/mathigatti/gpt-2-chatbot/blob/master/app.py#L37)). The personality of the chatbot is based on some previous example chat setted up [here](https://github.com/mathigatti/gpt-2-chatbot/blob/master/chatbot.py#L5), right now it has a religious/god like example.
